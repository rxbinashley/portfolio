        <h4>Time</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I worked on this project from October 2019 until January 2020. This was my first
          individual project from my second year as a Communication and Multimedia Design student. Looking back at the
          purpose of this project makes me realize how little I knew about UX design back then and how much I've learned
          in just one year. </p>

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
          User statement:
          "I can't find nice places to have dinner while I'm travelling. When I do find a nice
          place, I forget to visit there. I don't want to waste my time on looking for the best places to eat, but I
          still would love to go there."</p>
      </article>
      <article class="portfolio-wrapper grid-project">
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I came up with a concept for an app that helps users find places to eat, hangout or grab
          a coffee at their travel destination. The problem I wanted to solve was that people want to find nice places
          to go to without having to look for them so they can save time. While travelling, it's hard to find the best
          local places in town. Especially when you're a backpacker. The app recommends places as you go, based on your
          personal interests. </p>
